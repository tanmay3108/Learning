Interfaces cannot have static function

If you want statics, use an abstract class and inherit it, otherwise, remove the static. You can't define static methods in an interface because static methods belongs to a class not to an instance of class, and interfaces are not Classes

Static methods cannot be overridden


A final variable must be initialized at the declaration or in a constructor.

if object is made final it does not means it attributes cannot be changed..it means this will always point to same object and cannot be made to point some other object

difference between volatile and synchronized
